            <p style="font-weight:600;">Navigating the legal landscape of property transactions in Pakistan is crucial to ensure a smooth and secure real estate transaction. Whether you're buying or selling a property, understanding the legal process is essential. Here's a step-by-step guide to Pakistan's property laws:</p>
            <br>

             <h5><strong>Step 1: Verification of Ownership</strong></h5>
             <p>Before entering any transaction, it's imperative to verify the ownership of the property. This can be done through the local land revenue department or by consulting with a legal expert. Ensure that the seller possesses a clear and unencumbered title.</p>

            <h5><strong>Step 2: Due Diligence</strong></h5>
            </p>Engage a legal advisor to conduct a thorough due diligence on the property. This includes verifying land records, checking for any encumbrances, and ensuring that the property is free from disputes or litigation.</p>

            <h5><strong>Step 3: Sale Agreement</strong></h5>
            </p>Once due diligence is complete, a sale agreement should be drafted. This legal document outlines the terms and conditions of the sale, including the sale price, payment schedule, and possession date. Both parties should review and sign the agreement.</p>

            <h5><strong>Step 4: Stamp Duty and Registration</strong></h5>
            </p>The sale agreement should be executed on a stamp paper of appropriate value, as determined by the Stamp Act of the respective province. Subsequently, the sale deed must be registered with the relevant sub-registrar office.</p>

            <h5><strong>Step 5: Transfer of Possession</strong></h5>
            </p>Upon successful registration, possession of the property should be handed over to the buyer. This is a critical step and should be documented properly to avoid any future disputes.</p>

           <h5><strong>Step 6: Mutation of Title</strong></h5>
           </p>The buyer should apply for the mutation of title in their name with the local revenue department. This officially recognizes the change in ownership and ensures that property taxes are levied in the new owner's name.</p>
 
           <h5><strong>Step 7: No Objection Certificate (NOC) from Relevant Authorities</strong></h5>
           </p>Certain types of properties, such as agricultural land or properties in specific zones, may require a No Objection Certificate from the relevant authorities. Ensure that all necessary approvals are obtained.</p>

           <h5><strong>Step 8: Transfer of Utilities</strong></h5>
           </p>Transfer the utility connections (electricity, gas, water) to the new owner's name. This ensures uninterrupted services and compliance with legal requirements.</p>

           <h5><strong>Step 9: Payment of Capital Gains Tax</strong></h5>
           </p>Both the buyer and seller should be aware of the capital gains tax implications of the transaction. It's advisable to consult with a tax advisor to ensure compliance with tax laws.</p>

           <h5><strong>Step 10: Final Documentation</strong></h5>
           </p>Complete all necessary documentation, including obtaining a copy of the updated land record showing the new owner's name.</p>

          <br><br>
         <p class="text-center"><strong>Remember, it's crucial to engage legal professionals, such as lawyers and property advisors, to guide you through each step of the process. Additionally, staying informed about any changes in property laws and regulations is essential for a successful and legally sound property transaction in Pakistan.</strong></p>
